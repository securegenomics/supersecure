# SuperSecure

**Computation platform built for secure scientific collaboration & cryptographically verifiable science**

Simplest way of doing privacy-preserving collaborative science. Native for [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2020/07/20/homomorphic.html) and federated computation.

## Manifesto
Privacy-first
- No data leaves local unencrypted
- Server cannot decrypt data
  
Hyper-shareable
- Research protocols are github-repos

Instantly Verifiable Science (partially[^1])
- When you see a paper claiming a result, you should have a high-trust that the computation was run on our platform as advertised, obtaining the claimed result.
- Every computation, data, and protocol is a cryptographic artifact
- Scientific truth as a chain of commitments

### Corollaries
Local-first
- Anything can be done on local will be
- corollary of privacy-first

## Computation Protocols
**Multi-party Homomorphic Encryption**
```
protocol-*
|____________ receiver_generate_keys.py
|
|____________ client_compute.py
|____________ client_encrypt.py
|
|____________ server_compute.py
|
|____________ receiver_decrypt.py
|____________ receiver_interpret.py
|
|
|____________ config.yaml

e.g. Allele Frequency Analysis, GWAS, Federated ML 

**Private Query Homomorphic Encryption**
```
protocol-*
|____________ receiver_generate_keys.py

|____________ receiver_encrypt.py
|
|____________ client_compute.py
|____________ client_encrypt.py
|____________ client_query.py
|
|____________ receiver_decrypt.py

e.g. Drug discovery company tests its drug target variants on biobank data

**Secure Two-Party Computation (2PC)**
```

|____________ client_1_compute.py
|____________ client_1_encrypt.py
|
|____________ client_2_generate_keys.py
|____________ client_2_compute.py
|____________ client_2_encrypt.py

|____________ client_1_decrypt.py
|____________ client_1_interpret.py
|
|____________ client_2_decrypt.py
|____________ client_2_interpret.py
|
|____________ config.yaml
```
e.g. Paternal DNA test, where only participants can decrypt the result

**Local Only**
```
protocol-*
|____________ local_compute.py
|____________ config.yaml
```
e.g. Ancestry report on individual genome


## Constraints
[bozmen.io/constrains-are-your-friends](https://bozmen.io/constrains-are-your-friends)
- Single protocol language: Python
- Deterministic outputs: no random number generator
- On the server, data goes in/out encrypted and stays always such
- Server can never accept a private key



## Lower priority goals
LLM-first
â€“ results, and API are easy to process for AI Agents

[^1]: Full cryprographic verification of computations is computationally too expensive for most type of computations (see ZK circuits). That's why, we aim to go with weak-verification, where the computation is marked as verified by our platform, that can be checked by hashes of all the artificats (inputs, code, output). We aim to be a trusted layer. We are in search of better approaches that can be feasible (ideally with mathematical guarantees). If you have any ideas on this, please let us know in github issues or reach us at hbaristr@gmail.com!
